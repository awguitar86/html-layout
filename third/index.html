                The suffering that I see all around 
                It is enough to keep me crashing down till I
                I lie wrecked and reeling from these falls
                Still I believe there is a word in the wire
                And I believe there is a way through the fire
                And I believe there is a joy that blooms beyond these walls
                So keep holding on to hope without assurance
